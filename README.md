# Lend and Tend - airbnb for gardens!

## About

Created within 10 days: the idea was pitched to us by a social enterprise entrepeneur looking to turn their idea into a business, four of us then had 10 days to work with the client to create a MVP suiting their needs.

Lend and Tend, lets Londoners with gardens (and little time/interest in them) list their gardens, and those with no outdoor space to securely get in touch to rent/use them!

##Â Approach

From the clients breif we extracted key user stories, and put these into an ordered backlog on a kanban service called Trello.

With twice daily standups we then paired upon working our way through each user story.

We celebrated MVP milestones and presented to the client each time we had enough new functionality to warrant a new release.

All work was BDD test driven using rspec and capybara, and each time tests passed new code was automatically deployed to our heroku staging server.
