### Idea

Fewer people can afford their own gardens these days, and people with gardens often have to work such long hours they don't have time to do any gardening. Enter Lend and Tend. We match people with unused gardens they could lend, to people wanting to borrow a garden so they can tend.

### Technologies

This project is based on the ruby on rails framework. It uses geocoder for location encoding, scss and bootstrap for the front end. It was entirely made using BDD principals with Rspec and Capybara for tests.
